### How can I use it?
  - install the package by pip package manager.
  - after installing, type `tglogin` on your terminal
  - Now you need to get api_id and api_hash from here [Telegram](https://my.telegram.org/)
  from [Telethon document](https://docs.telethon.dev/en/latest/basic/signing-in.html):
    >Before working with Telegram’s API, you need to get your own API ID and hash:

### Need more examples?
Are you done with `tglogin`? so come with me.

## Unix based operating systems
`Download` a music from my `saved messages` and save it on `/Users/nima/Desktop/`:
```sh
$ tgcloud -m download -n nima -u me -p "/Users/nima/Desktop/" -c "sad but true"
```
```sh
$ tgcloud --mode download --name nima --username me --path "/Users/nima/Desktop/" --caption "sad but true"
```

`Upload` a banner with caption to my `saved messages`:
```sh
$ tgcloud -m upload -n nima -u me -p "/Users/nima/Desktop/banner.png" -c "Help me"
```
```sh
$ tgcloud --mode upload --name nima --username me --path "/Users/nima/Desktop/banner.png" --caption "Help me"
```

`Upload` a pdf to an `telegram ID`:
```sh
$ tgcloud -m upload -n nima -u @autisticbruh -p "/Users/nima/Desktop/file.pdf" -c "Help me"
```
`Search` and `download` a zip from telegram `chat_id group`:
```sh
$ tgcloud -m download -n nima -u -1001240213443 -p "/Users/nima/Desktop/" -c "best memes"
```
## not Unix (Lol I mean windows)
Just like unix but **CAREFUL** about paths, your path must not end with `\` !!
`Download` all PDFs from your `saved messages` and save it on `C:\Users\Nima\Desktop`:
```sh
$ tgcloud -m download -n nima -u me -p "C:\Users\Nima\Desktop" -c ".pdf"
```
### What is file_id?
from [Telegram Doc](https://core.telegram.org/api/files):
>When working with the API, it is sometimes necessary to send a relatively large file to the server. For example, when sending a message with a photo/video attachment or when setting the current user’s profile picture.

You can upload a file to Telegram once, and send it again to others or do things with file_id.
So when you upload a file, you can see the file_id.
So now what? If you have a Telegram bot and you have 50MB limitation for uploading and send to users, you can bypass this limitation by this trick and upload files upto 1.5GB and pass it by file_id or message_id or...

### Good to know
The config file can be found on `~/.telegram-cloud/` (Also `~\.telegram-cloud\` in windows)
Each login make *.session file which is located there and it cause script for logged-in user works globally.
Inside `telegram-cloud-config.ini`, you can find api_hash and api_id and name you've entered by `tglogin`
